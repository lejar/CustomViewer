This is a project that I started because I needed some nice pictures for a research report. I couldn't find any lattice viewers with simple input and customizable shaders, so I made my own.

Building this project:

  mkdir build
  cd build/
  cmake ..
  make
  
Executing the binary:
  It is important to remember to have the shader files in the same directory as the program.
  ./CustomViewer path/to/input/file.yaml
